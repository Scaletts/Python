Problem:
   Explain the role of the trailing else part of an extended if statement.
Solution:
    In an if/else if statement, the conditions are tested until one is found to be true. The conditionally executed statement(s) are executed and the program exits the if/else if statement. ... 
    The trailing else provides code that is executed when none of the conditions in the if/else if statement are true.

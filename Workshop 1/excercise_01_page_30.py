Problem:
    1. Suppose your script attempts to print the value of a variable that has not yet been
    assigned a value. How does the Python interpreter react?
    2. Miranda has forgotten to complete an arithmetic expression before the end of a line
    of code. How will the Python interpreter react?
    3. Why does Python code generate fewer types of syntax errors than code in other
    programming languages?
Solution:
    1.
    It halts the execution with an error message.
    2.
    It would tell her that an indentation is unexpected.
    3.
    Python's syntax generally allows the programmer to accomplish the programming 
    language in fewer steps, but it does take longer to run the program.

Problem:
    1. Describe what happens when the programmer enters the string "Greetings!" in
    the Python shell.
    2. Write a line of code that prompts the user for his or her name and saves the userâ€™s
    input in a variable called name.
    3. Answer the question, What is a Python script?
    4. Explain what goes on behind the scenes when your computer runs a Python program
Solution:
    1.
    print("Greetings!")
    or
    A = "Greetings!"
    print(A)
    2.
    name = input("Enter your name:")
    print(name)
    3.
    It's a language that Python already knows, 
    so when certain words are input into Python like "float" Python already knows the significance of "float".
    4.
    When a Python program is executed, it is translated into byte code. 
    This byte code is then sent to the Python virtual machine (PVM) for further interpretation and execution.

Problem:
   
    How does a Python programmer round a float value to the nearest int value?
    
Solution:
   
    Python provides an inbuilt function round() which rounds off to the given number of digits and returns the floating-point number, 
    if no number of digits is provided for round off, it rounds off the number to the nearest integer.

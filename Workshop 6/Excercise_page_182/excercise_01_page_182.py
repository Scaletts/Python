Problem:
       In what way is a recursive design different from top-down design?
Solution:
       In what way is a recursive design different from top-down design? Recursive functions are a type of functions in which the same function it called itself in the body of the function. 
       A recursion should have a base case and an iteration case. The base case is the termination point at which the program should halt.

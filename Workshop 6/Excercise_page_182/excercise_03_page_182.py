Problem:
       Describe the costs and benefits of defining and using a recursive function.
Solution:
        Why not to use recursion
        It is usually slower due to the overhead of maintaining the stack.
        It usually uses more memory for the stack.
        
        Why to use recursion
        Recursion adds clarity and (sometimes) reduces the time needed to write and debug code (but doesn't necessarily reduce space requirements or speed of execution).
        Reduces time complexity.
        Performs better in solving problems based on tree structures.

Problem:
    Explain the role of the variable in the header of a for loop.
Solution:
    A for-loop has two parts: a header specifying the iteration, and a body which is executed once per iteration. 
    The header often declares an explicit loop counter or loop variable, which allows the body to know which iteration is being executed.

Problem:
    
    Explain the differences between the data types int and float.
    
Solution:
   
    Integers and floats are two different kinds of numerical data. An integer (more commonly called an int) is a number without a decimal point. 
    A float is a floating-point number, which means it is a number that has a decimal place. 
    Floats are used when more precision is needed.

Problem:
     The Payroll Department keeps a list of employee information for each pay period in a text file.
        The format of each line of the file is the following:
                                <last name> <hourly wage> <hours worked>
        Write a program that inputs a filename from the user and prints to the terminal a report of the
        wages paid to the employees for the given period. The report should be in tabular format with
        the appropriate header. Each line should contain an employeeï¿½s name, the hours worked, and the
        wages paid for that period.



Solution:
    Display result
        Enter the file name: ../fileTest/data.txt
        Name            Hours      Total Pay
        Lambert            34          357.0
        Osborne            22          137.5

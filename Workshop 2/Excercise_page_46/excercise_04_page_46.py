Problem:
   
    What happens when the print function prints a string literal with embedded
    newline characters?
    
Solution:
    
    
    The print function denoted print() in a computer programming language such as Python is a function that prints values assigned to its parameter. 
    When assigned a string literal("I'm not going" for example) and break line statements/new line characters(\n), it prints the value such as "I'm not going\n" and starts a new line where a break line is indicated in the instruction(after "going" in the example)

Problem:
        Describe the processes of top-down design and stepwise refinement. Where does
the design start, and how does it proceed?
Solution:
      
    a problem might be difficult to solve as it stands. So you try to break it down into a set of smaller problems which might be solved more easily. This represents the first step of the process
    you then take the smaller problems, one at a time, and break them down into still smaller problems
    you keep repeating this process of breaking the problems down until all the problems facing you are small enough to handle
